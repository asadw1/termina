# Termina

Welcome to **Termina**! Inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, Termina is a multi-component project consisting of a RESTful API backend, a React-based web frontend, and Python CLI tools. This project provides a seamless music player experience with a shell-like interface.

## Overview

Termina consists of three main components:
1. **Backend**: A RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core (C#) that handles music playback and serves as the central hub for communication between components.
2. **Frontend**: A web-based UI built using React, providing a shell-like interface for users to input commands, display the current song information, and show an ASCII-like visualization for the track's length and position.
3. **CLI Tools**: Command-line interfaces for both Linux and Windows CMD, developed using Python, that send requests to the backend API and display results in the terminal.
